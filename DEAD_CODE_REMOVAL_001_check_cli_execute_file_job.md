# Dead Code Removal #001: check_cli_execute_file_job Function

## Summary
Removed unused utility function `check_cli_execute_file_job` from `dagster/_utils/__init__.py`.

## Change Details
- **File Modified**: `python_modules/dagster/dagster/_utils/__init__.py`
- **Lines Removed**: 28 lines (function definition + docstring)
- **Function Signature**: `check_cli_execute_file_job(path: str, pipeline_fn_name: str, env_file: Optional[str] = None) -> None`

## Analysis Performed
1. **Usage Analysis**: Comprehensive grep search showed function was only defined, never called
2. **String Reference Check**: Only referenced in our analysis documentation (PLAN.md)
3. **Import Impact**: No imports of this function found anywhere in codebase
4. **Test Coverage**: No tests were specifically testing this function

## Function Purpose (Historical)
The function appeared to be a legacy testing utility that:
- Created a test Dagster instance
- Built CLI command for pipeline execution
- Executed subprocess calls to run pipelines
- Used deprecated "pipeline" terminology instead of modern "job" terminology

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level: MINIMAL**
- Function was completely unused
- No imports or references found
- No breaking changes to public API
- No impact on existing functionality

## Testing Performed
✅ **Linting**: `make ruff` passed successfully  
✅ **Import Test**: `from dagster._utils import *` successful  
✅ **Unit Tests**: All utils tests passed (72 passed, 1 skipped)  
✅ **Regression Check**: No test failures detected  

## Files Changed
```
python_modules/dagster/dagster/_utils/__init__.py
    - Removed check_cli_execute_file_job function (lines 250-276)
    - Function contained legacy pipeline execution logic
    - Used deprecated terminology ("pipeline" vs "job")
```

## Validation Results
- **Pre-removal**: Function defined but never called
- **Post-removal**: All tests pass, no import errors
- **Code Quality**: Linting passed and cleaned up formatting

## Impact
- **Positive**: Removed 28 lines of dead code
- **Positive**: Eliminated legacy/deprecated terminology
- **Negative**: None identified

## Next Steps
This removal clears the way for additional dead code cleanup. The success of this low-risk change validates our analysis methodology for identifying unused functions.
