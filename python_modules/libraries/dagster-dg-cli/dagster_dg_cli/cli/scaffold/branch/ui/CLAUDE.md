# UI Abstraction Architecture for DG Scaffold Branch

*Documentation of the clean UI/logic separation implementation completed 2025-01-27*

## Overview

This document describes the UI abstraction layer that cleanly separates the business logic of `dg scaffold branch` from its user interface implementation. The architecture follows a reconciliation-based pattern with event-driven state management, enabling complete UI swappability while preserving existing functionality.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Reconciliation Pattern
The UI renders based on complete application state and only updates when the state actually changes. This provides:
- Predictable rendering behavior
- Efficient updates (no unnecessary re-renders)
- Complete state visibility for debugging

### 2. Event-Driven State Management
Business logic emits events rather than making direct UI calls:
- **Decoupling**: Business logic has zero knowledge of UI implementation
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and test state transitions
- **Auditability**: All state changes flow through a single event system

### 3. Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Business Logic**: Handles AI interactions, git operations, planning
- **State Management**: Tracks application state and coordinates UI updates
- **UI Layer**: Renders state and handles user interactions

## Core Components

### 1. Abstract Interface (`interface.py`)

```python
class ScaffoldUI(ABC):
    """Abstract UI interface for scaffold operations."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def render_state(self, state: ScaffoldState) -> None:
        """Render the complete UI state (reconciliation pattern)."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_plan_approval(self, plan_content: str) -> tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        """Get user approval for a generated plan."""
        
    # ... other interaction methods
```

**Design Notes:**
- All UI implementations must provide these methods
- Methods are focused on user interactions, not display logic
- State rendering is handled separately from user input collection

### 2. State Models (`state.py`)

#### Core State Model
```python
@record
class ScaffoldState:
    """Complete state of the scaffold operation for UI reconciliation."""
    ui_state: UIState
    prompt: str = ""
    branch_name: str = ""
    pr_title: str = ""
    pr_url: str = ""
    current_plan: Optional[str] = None
    progress_operations: dict[str, Any] = None
    messages: list[dict] = None
    diagnostics_enabled: bool = False
    # ... additional fields
```

#### Event Types
```python
@record
class ProgressEvent:
    """Progress update event."""
    operation_id: str
    operation_name: str
    status: str  # "started", "progress", "completed", "failed"
    message: str = ""
    progress: Optional[float] = None

@record  
class StatusMessage:
    """Status message for user."""
    level: str  # "info", "success", "warning", "error"
    message: str
    timestamp: str
    details: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None
```

#### State Manager
```python
class ScaffoldStateManager:
    """Manages scaffold state and UI reconciliation."""
    
    def update_state(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        """Update state and trigger UI reconciliation."""
        
    def emit_event(self, event: UIEvent) -> None:
        """Process an event and update state accordingly."""
```

**Design Notes:**
- Uses `@record` decorator for immutable, type-safe data structures
- State updates are atomic - entire new state is created
- Events are processed into state changes automatically
- UI only renders when state actually changes

### 3. Click Implementation (`click_ui.py`)

```python
class ClickScaffoldUI(ScaffoldUI):
    """Click-based UI implementation maintaining current UX."""
    
    def render_state(self, state: ScaffoldState) -> None:
        """Render current state using Click."""
        # Only render state transitions and new messages
        # Manage progress spinners based on operation status
        
    def get_plan_approval(self, plan_content: str) -> tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        """Interactive plan approval matching current UX."""
        # Preserved original interactive prompt behavior
```

**Design Notes:**
- Maintains 100% compatibility with existing CLI experience
- Manages spinner lifecycle based on progress events
- Avoids duplicate message rendering through state tracking

## Integration Points

### 1. Business Logic Integration

#### Before (Direct UI Coupling)
```python
# In git.py
def create_git_branch(branch_name: str) -> str:
    run_git_command(["checkout", "-b", branch_name])
    click.echo(f"Created branch: {branch_name}")  # Direct UI coupling
    return sha
```

#### After (Event-Driven)
```python  
# In git.py
def create_git_branch(branch_name: str, event_emitter) -> str:
    run_git_command(["checkout", "-b", branch_name])
    event_emitter(create_status_message("info", f"Created branch: {branch_name}"))
    return sha
```

### 2. Command Entry Point

```python
# In command.py
def execute_scaffold_branch_command(...):
    # Create UI and state manager
    ui = ClickScaffoldUI(disable_progress=disable_progress)
    state_manager = ScaffoldStateManager(ui)
    
    try:
        # Initialize state
        state_manager.update_state(
            ui_state=UIState.INITIAL,
            prompt=prompt_text,
            diagnostics_enabled=(diagnostics_level != "off")
        )
        
        # Business logic emits events instead of direct UI calls
        state_manager.emit_event(ProgressEvent(
            operation_id="planning",
            operation_name="Generating plan",
            status="started"
        ))
        
        # ... rest of business logic
        
    finally:
        state_manager.cleanup()
```

## UI States and Transitions

```
INITIAL → PLANNING → PLAN_REVIEW → EXECUTING → COMPLETED
                        ↓
                    (refinement loop)
```

### State Descriptions
- **INITIAL**: Command started, collecting input
- **PLANNING**: AI generating implementation plan
- **PLAN_REVIEW**: User reviewing and potentially refining plan
- **EXECUTING**: Implementation in progress (branch creation, content generation)
- **COMPLETED**: All operations finished successfully
- **ERROR**: Error state for failure handling

## Event Flow Architecture

```
Business Logic → Events → State Manager → State Changes → UI Reconciliation
```

### Event Processing Flow
1. **Business Logic** emits events (`ProgressEvent`, `StatusMessage`, etc.)
2. **State Manager** processes events into state changes
3. **State Manager** triggers UI reconciliation if state changed
4. **UI Implementation** renders new state if different from last render

### Benefits of Event-Driven Architecture
- **Single Source of Truth**: All state changes flow through one system
- **Debugging**: Complete audit trail of all state changes
- **Testing**: Easy to unit test state transitions in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New event types can be added without changing existing code

## Adding New UI Implementations

To create a new UI implementation (e.g., web UI, terminal UI):

### 1. Implement the Interface
```python
class WebScaffoldUI(ScaffoldUI):
    def render_state(self, state: ScaffoldState) -> None:
        # Send state updates to web frontend
        self.websocket.send(json.dumps(asdict(state)))
        
    def get_plan_approval(self, plan_content: str) -> tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        # Wait for user response via web interface
        return self.wait_for_user_response(plan_content)
```

### 2. Update Entry Point
```python
# In command.py - add UI selection logic
if use_web_ui:
    ui = WebScaffoldUI(websocket_connection)
else:
    ui = ClickScaffoldUI(disable_progress=disable_progress)

state_manager = ScaffoldStateManager(ui)
```

### 3. No Business Logic Changes Required
All business logic (`planning.py`, `git.py`, `ai.py`) remains unchanged - they only emit events.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. State Management Testing
```python
def test_progress_event_updates_state():
    state_manager = ScaffoldStateManager(MockUI())
    
    state_manager.emit_event(ProgressEvent(
        operation_id="test", 
        operation_name="Test Op", 
        status="started"
    ))
    
    assert "test" in state_manager.state.progress_operations
    assert state_manager.state.progress_operations["test"]["status"] == "started"
```

### 2. UI Implementation Testing  
```python
def test_click_ui_renders_messages():
    ui = ClickScaffoldUI()
    state = ScaffoldState(
        ui_state=UIState.INITIAL,
        messages=[{"level": "info", "message": "Test message"}]
    )
    
    with patch('click.echo') as mock_echo:
        ui.render_state(state)
        mock_echo.assert_called_with("Test message")
```

### 3. Integration Testing
```python  
def test_full_event_flow():
    mock_ui = MockUI()
    state_manager = ScaffoldStateManager(mock_ui)
    
    # Emit event like business logic would
    state_manager.emit_event(create_status_message("info", "Test"))
    
    # Verify UI was updated
    assert mock_ui.render_called
    assert "Test" in mock_ui.last_rendered_state.messages[0]["message"]
```

## Performance Considerations

### State Comparison Optimization
```python
def _state_changed(self) -> bool:
    """Check if state has changed since last render."""
    return self._last_rendered_state != self.state
```

The state manager only triggers UI updates when the state actually changes, preventing unnecessary rendering.

### Memory Management
- State objects use `@record` for efficient immutable updates
- Old state references are automatically garbage collected
- Progress operations are cleaned up when operations complete

## Future Enhancements

### 1. State Persistence
```python
# Save state for debugging/resumption
with open("scaffold_session.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(asdict(state_manager.state), f)
```

### 2. Real-time Collaboration
Multiple UI clients could subscribe to the same state manager for collaborative scaffolding sessions.

### 3. Advanced Progress Tracking
```python
@record
class DetailedProgress:
    operation_id: str
    steps_completed: int
    total_steps: int
    current_step_description: str
    estimated_time_remaining: Optional[float]
```

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing command-line behavior is preserved exactly
- Same CLI options, same output format, same interactive prompts
- No breaking changes to the public API

### Gradual Migration Path
The architecture allows for gradual migration:
1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Abstract UI layer (completed)
2. **Phase 2**: Add new UI implementations as needed
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance state management with additional features

### Code Standards Compliance
- Uses `@record` decorator as per Dagster coding standards
- Follows type annotation requirements
- Maintains immutable data structures
- Proper error handling and cleanup
