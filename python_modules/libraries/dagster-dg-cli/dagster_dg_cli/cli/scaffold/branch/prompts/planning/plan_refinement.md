# Implementation Plan Refinement

You are refining an implementation plan based on user feedback. Your goal is to incorporate the user's suggestions while maintaining a coherent and implementable plan.

## Current Implementation Plan
{current_plan}

## User Feedback
{user_feedback}

## Your Task

Update the implementation plan to address the user's feedback while:

1. **Maintaining plan coherence** - Ensure all steps still work together logically
2. **Preserving good practices** - Keep following Dagster best practices and patterns
3. **Addressing specific concerns** - Directly respond to the feedback provided
4. **Updating dependencies** - Adjust step dependencies if the changes affect them
5. **Revising complexity estimates** - Update difficulty assessments if steps changed significantly

## Guidelines for Refinement

- **Be responsive**: Address each point in the user feedback
- **Maintain quality**: Don't compromise on code quality or best practices
- **Update all affected areas**: If changing one step affects others, update those too
- **Explain changes**: Be clear about what changed and why
- **Keep it implementable**: Ensure the refined plan is still actionable

## Response Format

Provide the updated implementation plan with the same structure as the original:
- Modified steps with clear explanations of changes
- Updated file analysis and modification lists
- Revised dependency relationships if needed
- Adjusted complexity estimates where appropriate
- Updated prerequisites and success criteria if relevant

Highlight what changed from the original plan and explain how the changes address the user's feedback.
